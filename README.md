# Model Analysis and Visualizations

## Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive analysis and visualization of the correlation between three solar diffuse models and DHI (Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance) values from the DWD (Deutscher Wetterdienst) dataset. It also includes a detailed examination of monthly irradiance trends in two cities of Germany, MÃ¼hldorf and Hamburg, over the years 2020 to 2023, focusing on both measured and modeled solar irradiance data.

## Correlation Analysis Between Models and DHI Values

The heatmap analysis reveals a strong correlation among the three models, as well as between the models and the DHI values from the DWD dataset. The minimal differences between the models suggest that they perform similarly in terms of their relationship with the DHI data. This high degree of consistency underscores the reliability of the models in predicting or aligning with the DHI values, making them valuable tools for solar energy analysis and forecasting.

## Monthly Irradiance Analysis (2020-2023)

### Data Breakdown

- **GHS (Global Horizontal Solar Irradiance):** Measures the total solar radiation received per unit area by a horizontal surface, including both direct and diffuse components.
- **Perez Irradiance:** A model-based estimation of solar irradiance that accounts for both direct and diffuse radiation, providing a more detailed representation of solar energy availability.

### Visualization Features

- **Subplots for Each Year (2020-2023):** A 2x2 grid displaying annual irradiance trends, allowing for easy comparison across years.
- **GHS Curve (Orange) and Perez Irradiance Curve (Green):** Illustrating monthly trends in solar irradiance, with distinct curves for measured (GHS) and modeled (Perez) data.
- **Shaded Areas:** Representing variability in the data, providing insights into the range of irradiance values observed each month.
- **Monthly Maximums:** Highlighting peak irradiance values using markers, making it easy to identify periods of maximum solar energy potential.

### Key Insights

- **Seasonal Trends:** Irradiance values are consistently higher during summer months and lower in winter, reflecting the expected seasonal variation in solar energy availability.
- **GHS vs. Perez Comparison:** The analysis highlights discrepancies between measured (GHS) and modeled (Perez) irradiance data, offering insights into the accuracy and limitations of the models.
- **Year-to-Year Variations:** The data reveals fluctuations in solar energy potential over the years, which can be attributed to factors such as weather patterns and climatic changes.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into both the correlation between models and DHI values, as well as the seasonal and yearly variations in solar irradiance. By understanding these trends, the findings contribute to improved forecasting, optimization of solar energy systems, and better utilization of renewable energy resources.
